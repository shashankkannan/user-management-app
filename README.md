# Full Stack Web Application with Automated Testing

This is a full stack web application built with a Flask backend and a React (Vite) frontend, featuring comprehensive automated testing across both API and UI layers.

The backend is developed using Flask, supporting key features like user registration, login, update, delete operations, and protected routes secured with JWT tokens. Postman is used for API request creation, and Newman is used to run collection-based tests directly from the command line.

The frontend is built with Vite and React, delivering a fast and responsive user interface. The frontend is tested using Pytest with Selenium for traditional browser-based UI testing, and Pytest with Playwright for both headless and headed automated UI test execution.

This project demonstrates the use of modern full stack development practices along with multiple testing strategies to ensure robustness, reliability, and test coverage across components.
